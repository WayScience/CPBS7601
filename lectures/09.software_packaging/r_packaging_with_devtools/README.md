# Packaging Tutorial: Using devtools, usethis, and roxygen2

This tutorial introduces R package development using a combination of devtools, usethis, and roxygen2.
These tools simplify the process of creating, documenting, and maintaining R packages, making it easier to share your code with others and publish it to CRAN or GitHub.

## Overview of the Tools

- [devtools:](https://devtools.r-lib.org/) Simplifies many aspects of R package development, such as installing, building, and checking packages. It is a wrapper around several tools, streamlining the process.
- [usethis:](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) Automates the setup of package files and structure, including version control integration, setting up continuous integration, and managing project metadata.
- [roxygen2:](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/) Makes documenting R packages easy by allowing inline documentation in your code, which it then converts into NAMESPACE and .Rd files.

## Instructions

See [`example_r_package_build.R`](example_r_package_build.R) for complete details.
