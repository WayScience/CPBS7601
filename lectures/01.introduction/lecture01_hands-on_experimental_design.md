# Hands-on activity #1:

## Designing a simple computational biology experiment

### Objective:

Design a simple computational biology experiment in 30 minutes.
Do not overthink this and plan your time accordingly.
You are not graded on any hands-on activity.
We will not collect deliverables.
I encourage you to think about data and research questions from your current research project.
Get things wrong!

In word processing software (e.g., MS Word, google docs) jot down your answers to the following instructions:

### Instructions:

1. Describe your data:
   - What is your dataset?
   - From what system or experiment does your data originate?
   - What type of data are you working with (e.g., gene expression, proteomics, imaging, etc.)?
1. Formulate your hypothesis:
   - What is the primary question or hypothesis you aim to test?
   - Why is this question significant to your research?
1. Determine controls:
   - Identify your negative controls (samples expected to show no effect).
   - Identify your positive controls (samples expected to show a known effect).
1. Select your analysis approach:
   - What statistical test or analysis method will you use (e.g., t-test, ANOVA, machine learning algorithm)?
   - Justify your choice of analysis method.
1. Plan how you will interpret your findings:
   - How will you analyze and interpret the results of your experiment?
   - What will be your criteria for determining whether your hypothesis is supported or refuted?
1. Plan next steps:
   - Based on your potential findings, outline the next steps for your research.
   - Consider further experiments, additional analyses, or new hypotheses to explore.

### Deliverables:

A ½ to 1½ page report covering the above points.

### Tips:

- Be specific and concise in your descriptions and justifications.
- Move fast, fail, and do not be perfect.
