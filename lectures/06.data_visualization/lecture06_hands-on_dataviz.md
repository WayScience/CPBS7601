# Hands-On Activity #5:

## Student Competition: Create the Worst Graph

### Objective

To gain familiarity with plotting software (e.g., `ggplot2`) while having fun exploring the concept of poor data visualization through the creative challenge of making intentionally bad graphs.

### Data

We encourage you to use the built-in R dataset “diamonds”:

```R
data(“diamonds”)
```

However, if you feel strongly, you can select any dataset you would like.
It is ok in this competition to give yourself an advantage!

### Tasks

1. Be creative (30 minutes):

   - Use data to create a graph that intentionally incorporates common data visualization mistakes. Think about how to make the graph misleading or difficult to interpret.

1. Present your graph:

   - Each student will present their graph to the class, explaining why it is ineffective or "bad." Focus on the specific mistakes made and how they impact the graph's clarity and accuracy.
   - Use no more than 2 minutes of time.

1. Vote:

   - After all presentations, students will vote on which graph they think is the worst.
   - The winner gets a prize and bragging rights.
   - If necessary, the previous year's winner will make the tie-breaking vote.

### Deliverables

- A PNG image of the worst graph created.

### Tips

- Close your eyes.
- Think about what you like to see in a graph and do the opposite.
- There are many ways to create a bad graph, so be creative!

### Tools

- Students are encouraged to use `ggplot2` (using the previous tutorial as inspiration).
- Alternatives include `plotnine` (Python) and `seaborn` (Python).
