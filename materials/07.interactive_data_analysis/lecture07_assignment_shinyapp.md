# Assignment #2:

## Build a Simple Shiny App

### Objective:

- To learn how Shiny works through exploration and trial and error.
- To learn how to customize the app for your own use-case, focusing on creating an interactive application that helps analyze your data.

### Data:

- Source: Students should use a dataset from their current or past rotation/lab.
- Permission: If students are not using a public dataset, they should ask the rotation PI for permission to use it for this assignment
  Alternatively, they can select a public dataset from a published paper in their field, or a built-in toy dataset which would fit the assignment objective.

**Note: There will later be an option to "publish" the Shiny app, so non-public datasets should not be published without permission.**

### Tasks

- Use ggplot2 to code a visualization that tells a compelling (or non-compelling) story.
- Implement at least three dynamic features to explore the dataset.
- Use `shinydashboard` or `shinythemes` to create an aesthetically pleasing style.
- Focus on functionality.
  - Consider whether having a dynamic plot is even helpful for analyzing the data.
  - Consider which aspects would be helpful for a user to explore.
- \[Optional\] Publish Shiny app to https://www.shinyapps.io

### Deliverables

- An `app.R` file and/or an HTML link to their published app.
- Brief report (Â½ to 1 page): Include the following details:
  - Visualization purpose and goals:
    - Describe what your application visualizes.
    - What data are you visualizing?
    - Why is being interactive important?
    - How do you hope users will leverage your tool?
  - Limitations:
    - What are some limitations of your applications?
    - Can they be improved with software or are they inherent in the data/approach?

### Tips

- Students will receive a full tutorial on Shiny app development.

### Tools

- Suggested packages: `shiny`, `ggplot2`, `shinydashboard`, `shinythemes`
- Students will have access to all online resources and examples to aid their development.
