# Assignment #3:

## Create an R or Python Package for a Frequently Used Function

### Objective:

- Choose a function that you (or your lab) have developed and use frequently.
- You could also choose a random function.
- Create an R or Python package that implements this function, focusing on usability, documentation, and adherence to best practices.

### Instructions:

1. Select your function:

   - Choose a function that is commonly used in your work or one that provides a significant benefit in your research.
   - Ensure that the function is well-defined and can stand alone as a useful utility.
   - Or, don't do this and pick a random function.

1. Version control \[optional\]:

   - Initialize a Git repository for your package and make regular commits to document your development process.

1. Package structure:

   - Create a new package using either:
     - R: Use `usethis::create_package("path/to/package"`)\` to set up your package structure.
     - Python: Use `poetry init` to scaffold your package.
     - From scratch: this is often the best method, since you have complete control

1. Implement your function:

   - Write the function code and place it in the appropriate directory:
     - R: Place your function in the R/ directory.
     - Python: Place your function in the your_package/ directory.

1. Documentation:

   - Write clear and comprehensive documentation for your function:
     - R: Use `roxygen2` comments to document your function.
     - Python: Use docstring,s and consider using Sphinx for generating additional documentation.

1. Testing \[optional\]:

   - Create a set of tests to ensure your function behaves as expected:
     - R: Use the testthat package to write unit tests for your function, ensuring it handles various input scenarios correctly.
     - Python: Use pytest to write tests for your function, covering edge cases and expected outputs.

1. Package metadata:

   - Fill in the metadata for your package:
     - R: Add information to the DESCRIPTION file, including the package name, version, author, and description.
     - Python: Update setup.py (or pyproject.toml if using Poetry) with the package name, version, author, and description.

1. Install and test your package:

   - Install your package locally to ensure it works as intended:
     - R: Use devtools::install() to install your package.
     - Python: Use pip install . to install your package in editable mode.

1. Publish your package \[optional\]:

   - If you wish, consider publishing your package to:
     - R: CRAN or GitHub.
     - Python: PyPI or GitHub.

### Deliverables:

- A compressed package (e.g., tar.gz).
  - In R, this is output from devtools::build()
  - In python, this is output from poetry build
- \[Optional\] Instead of the compressed package, send your completed R or Python package in a Git repository
- Brief report (½ to 1 page): Include the following details:
  - Purpose: Describe what your package does. Why is your package useful?
  - Limitations: What are some limitations of your package? How can this improve in the future?

### Resources:

- R Package Development:
  - R Packages by Hadley Wickham
  - devtools Package Documentation
  - testthat Package Documentation
- Python Package Development:
  - Python Packaging User Guide
  - pytest Documentation
  - Sphinx Documentation

### Tips:

- Focus on writing clean, reusable code and clear documentation.
- Make sure your package is user-friendly and easy to install.
- Don’t hesitate to ask for feedback from peers or mentors as you develop your package.
