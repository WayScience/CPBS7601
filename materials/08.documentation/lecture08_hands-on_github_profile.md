# Hands-On Activity #6:

## Create a Custom GitHub Profile Using Markdown

### Objective:

- Design and build a GitHub profile that highlights your scientific work, skills, and projects, effectively turning your GitHub profile into a professional and personal resume.

### Tasks:

1. Set up your GitHub profile repository:

- If you haven’t already, create a GitHub repository named after your username (e.g., username/username).
  - This repository will automatically become your GitHub profile when populated with a README.md file.

2. Craft your profile using markdown:

- Use Markdown to create the content of your GitHub profile.
  - This should highlight your identity as a scientist and person. Include:
    - **Introduction:** Who you are, what you work on, your current role.
    - **Research and Projects:** Key scientific projects, findings, or publications.
    - **Skills:** Technologies, programming languages, tools you are proficient in.
    - **Education and Experience:** Include any degrees, certifications, or career milestones.
    - **Links:** Social media profiles (Twitter, LinkedIn, personal website) or other relevant platforms.

3. Use a variety of markdown features:

- Use headers to structure your profile (e.g., #, ##, ###).
- Include links to papers, projects, or online profiles.
- Add images (e.g., logos, profile pictures) to make your profile visually appealing.
- Use code snippets or inline code to show technical examples
- Create lists to organize skills or project details (bullet or numbered lists).

4. Optional visual enhancements:

- Incorporate Shields.io badges to showcase technologies, languages, or
  contributions (e.g., badges for Python, R, GitHub commits, ORCID, etc.).
- Use tables or icons for a structured look and feel.

5. Be creative and personalize:

- Your GitHub profile is not only a showcase of your work but also a personal reflection of your style.
  - There is no prescribed content—feel free to highlight what makes you unique as a scientist.
- Think of ways to make your profile engaging for potential collaborators or employers who might visit your page.

6. \[Optional\] Convert Your Profile to a GitHub Pages Website:

- If you want to make your profile accessible as a GitHub Pages site, you can convert it to a personal website.
- Enable GitHub Pages under the repository settings.
- After enabling, your profile will be available at https://username.github.io.
- This can turn your Markdown profile into a hosted personal website, providing another way to showcase your work online.

### Deliverables:

No formal deliverable is required. This is an open-ended exercise to encourage creativity and self-expression.
Take charge of your career and education!
