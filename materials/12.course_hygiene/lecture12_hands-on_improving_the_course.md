# Hands-On Activity #8:

## Improving the GitHub Course Materials

### Objective:

To make a single improvement to the GitHub course materials by identifying an issue (e.g., typo, refactor, enhancement, etc.) and filing a pull request to fix it.

### Instructions:

1. Identify an issue

- Throughout your participation in the course, we expect that you have identified an area of improvement for our course materials on GitHub.
  - This may be a big or tiny fix.
  - Just because the fix may be obvious to you, it does not mean that it is obvious to the course director, teaching assistant, or the other students.
- We aim to improve the course for the future!

2. Make the fix

- Confirm your fork is up to date with the main branch of the WayScience upstream remote repository.
- Create a new branch

```bash
git checkout -b insert-feature-name-to-fix-here
```

- Make the fix in your IDE and perform the standard GitHub procedures of add, commit, push
- File a pull request into the upstream main repository
  - Tag the instructor to let them know about the pull request

### Deliverables:

- Open at least one pull request that contains a fix/enhancement to the course GitHub repository

### Tips:

- Make your pull request a single change and make it bite-sized. This encourages more efficient pull request review.
