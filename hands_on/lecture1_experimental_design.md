# Hands-On Activity #1: Designing A Simple Computational Biology Experiment

## Objective:

Design a simple computational biology experiment. I encourage you to think about data and research questions from your current research project.

In word processing *software* (e.g., MS Word, google docs) follow the instructions:

## Instructions:

1. Describe your **data:**
    - What is your dataset? 
    - From what system or experiment does your data originate? 
    - What type of data are you working with (e.g., gene expression, proteomics, imaging, etc.)?

2. Formulate your **hypothesis:**
    - What is the primary question or hypothesis you aim to test? 
    - Why is this question significant to your research?

3. Determine **controls:**
    - Identify your negative controls (samples expected to show no effect). 
    - Identify your positive controls (samples expected to show a known effect).

4. Select your analysis **approach:**
    - What statistical test or analysis method will you use (e.g., t-test, ANOVA, machine learning algorithm)?

    - Justify your choice of analysis method.

5. Plan how you will interpret your **findings:**
    - How will you analyze and interpret the results of your experiment? 
    - What will be your criteria for determining whether your hypothesis is supported or refuted?

6. Plan next **steps:**
    - Based on your potential findings, outline the next steps for your research. 
    - Consider further experiments, additional analyses, or new hypotheses to explore.

## Deliverables:

- A 1-2 page written report covering each of the above points.

## Tips:
- Be specific and detailed in your descriptions and justifications. - Use visuals (e.g., diagrams, charts) to enhance your explanations where possible. - Consider discussing your ideas with peers or mentors for feedback.
